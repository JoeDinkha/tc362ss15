<h2>Introducing Servage</h2>
<p>Many times that I have considered hosting my own personal webpage, whether it be for a specific resource or a personal online resume/blog, I always found myself looking for hosts that offer the biggest bang for the buck.  One provider that has stuck out in my preferences and recommendations to others has been the German-based company named Servage Hosting (www.servage.net). This company was founded in 1998 under a different name, but the current one is the mold of the words "Serve" and "Age." This new corporate tag is a prideful name that represents how the company keeps a goal of serving their clients and staying up to date with modern technology.

Offered Services
Servage's strong selling point is that they offer unlimited web hosting from all aspects.  This includes zero limitations on usable disk space, bandwidth, quantity of email accounts, and even includes a free domain creation or transfer! Not only that, but this is all attainable for an affordable rate of $4.45/month. Other services offered by Servage include purchases of domain names (at various yearly rates), and virtual private servers for $19.95/month (1 CPU, 600MB RAM, 150GB HDD space, and 5TB Bandwidth).  When I first stumbled upon this host I thought that there was absolutely no way they could offer all of this without a catch, and if they did, I questioned their quality.

After further review and reaching out to people who are hosted by this provider, I was able to confirm that they are indeed reliable and do offer these remarkable services. One specific hosted website I used to go on when I was a kid was www.BooMansion.net (a fan-site for Super Mario Bros. games) happened to be hosted by Servage.  I reached out to their webmaster (by email) who resides in Tennessee, he was able to assure me that the services advertised are honored and that they are very dependable. It is not hard to trust his word when there are currently 180,725 being hosted by them and the fact that they are approved by three websites as a certified web hosting service.

Other features to note is up-to-date support for the latest and various versions of frontend and backend web design languages (XML, Rails, PHP, Python CGI, Flash, etc..), as well as support for 1000 MySQL databases. This allows for the most dynamic website capabilities on a host that provides unlimited space to take advantage of.

<h2>Technical Capability</h2>
<p>
One would believe that Servage must have a pretty strong system in place to be able to offer such high capacity features. This is indeed true. Their servers are powered by their own custom Linux operating system called ServageOS, supported by Intel Multicore Processors, RAID protected HDDs, and more than 20GB RAM available per cluster. This unique clustered hosting structure allows improvements to scalability and reduces downtime, allowing a client's web service to run smoothly. In the event one server should fail it is immediately and automatically replaced by another cluster (high availibility).
</p>

<h2>Network</h2>
<p>
Servage currently is interconnected to many major regional ISPs and telecommunications providers such as Cogent Communications, AT&T, Tiscali, Versatel, and TeliaSonera, just to name a few. Being linked to these companies along with being on operating network AS 29671 allows them to have distribution among the highest ranked connectivity degrees on the Internet. 

Prior to becoming an Open Source routing network on GNU Zebra (2007), Servage had used Cisco routers. Now, all of their equipment like their servers and routers are located in their own private datacenter within a "seismic inactive area," connected by four independent gigabit fiber optic links.  Top performance even during peak hours is ensured as they upgrade their bandwidth once it has only hit half its total utilization! Low network latency is surely to be assumed as Servage can reach over 120 networks in just one hop. Destinations worldwide can be connected at a pretty fast rate with this network structure setup.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
Secure server SSL certificate programs are offered at Servage. Not only does this protect the information and data stored on the website but it also services the protection of visitors and customers as well. Servage credits their custom Linux OS on their servers for having a strong sense of security as well. This was introduced to combat past events of hackings by webpage injections. Most notably, this OS creates full separation from its customers and other security improvements for hosting environments.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Viewing Servage from the client side, and perceiving them as a server manager, their reputation and offered services seem very reasonable. They are an award winning host, one of the awards they were notably nominated for was the 2010 XBIZ Award for "Web Host of the Year." Others include editorials rating them as the "#1 Unix Webhost Directory," "Editor's Choice," and "Best Overall Webhost." With a strongly supported technical infrastructure, strong number of clientele, and near unbeatable rates for quality of service, I do not see why they would not be a great, first (if not only) web host for anyone creating a conventional website. Customer support and satisfaction being rated at 97%, 24/7 live helpdesk support, and 99.98% guaranteed uptime ensures this dependability.
